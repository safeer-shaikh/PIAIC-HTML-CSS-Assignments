    </ul>
    <h1><span style="font-size: 50px;">C</span>loud Native Computing:</h1>
    <p>
        The Cloud Native Computing Program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like, <b><em>linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React, React Native</em></b>while introducing the students to development of Microservices and softwares development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h1><span style="font-size: 50px;">A</span>rtificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
        The artificial Intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like, <b><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,TenserFlow 2.0, and Flask</em></b>and teaching deploying practical AI soluction and use cases and ending with real life examples of modern day AI in practice
    </p>
    <h1><span style="font-size: 50px;">B</span>lockChain Computing</h1>
    <p>
        The main Emphasis of <b>BlockChain</b> program is to understand the blockchain like <b><em>Ethereum and Hyperledger (Fabrics)</em></b> and learn to program in language such as solidity, JavaScript, framworks like node.js. The program also introduce them to development of Distributed Apps,(DApps) framwordslike web3, and truffle and an in-depth understanding of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), and how to develop and offer an initial coin offer (ICO)of a crypto-token
    </p>
    <h1><span style="font-size: 50px;">I</span>nternet of Things</h1>
    <p>
        the Internet of things program introduce the students to open source development technologies like <b><em>Rust, Embedded Rush, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes,</em></b> while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice Computing for device control
